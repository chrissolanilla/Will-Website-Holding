    <p> Constellation mainly focuses on Value-Add and Core-Plus strategies. 
        We believe that these investment strategies yield appropriate risk-adjusted 
        returns in relation to investor exposure, which is typically minimized through 
        in-place income. Opportunistic investments are reserved for extraordinary 
        properties that meet certain criteria, including barrier to entry markets, 
        low basis and strong sponsorship. We acquire assets in specific sunbelt metro 
        areas with proven demographics, barriers to entry and strong economic demand drivers.

        We seek to identify high-quality properties in locations with a clear and sustainable path towards growth and value creation. 
        We aim to consistently study target markets and track demand driver metrics
