                <p>
                    Mr. Burke is one of the original founding partners of Burke
                    Construction Group. He has served as the CEO since 1997. Mr.
                    Burke's primary focus is on developing and maintaining
                    client relations. He works closely on the preconstruction
                    services, preparation of project estimates and oversees

                <p>
                    Mr. Burke started his career in the construction industry as
                    a field engineer over thirty years ago. Prior to founding
                    Burke Construction, Mr. Burke was the founder of The Tower
                    Group which he owned and managed for twelve years prior to
                    selling the firm to an international company. Under Burke's
                    leadership Tower grew to over 250 employees and 185 million
                    in annual revenues. Prior to founding the Tower Group, Burke
                    worked for ten years with a prominent local Florida
                    developer serving as President of their Construction
                    Division where he designed and constructed more than 4.2
                    million square feet of commercial space. Mr. Burke graduated
                    from Indiana State University with a B.S. in Construction
                    Management in 1982. In addition to his leadership role with

                    Bush to serve on the State of Florida's Construction

                <h3>Steve Alessi</h3>
                <h4><i>Ethics and Values Advisor</i></h4>
                <p>
                    Pastor Steve Alessi is a renowned spiritual leader and
                    entrepreneur, bringing over four decades of dedicated
                    ministry and community service to Legacy 5. A Miami native,
                    Steve was called into ministry at the age of 19 and has
                    since fulfilled his calling with unwavering commitment.
                    Steve earned his degree from Southeastern University in 1984
                    and served alongside his parents as Associate Pastor of
                    Grace Church of Kendall. In 1997, he and his wife, Mary,
                    founded Metro Life Church in Doral, Florida, where they have
                    since fostered a vibrant, faith-driven community. In 2013,
                    they expanded their mission by transforming Grace Church
                    into the Dadeland Campus of Metro Life Church, uniting the
                    congregations under one roof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His life and ministry are testaments to resilience and
                    faith, underscored by his survival of a widow-maker heart
                    attack in 2007. This life-altering event inspired him to
                    author "Forty Two - How To Finish Strong When You Thought
                    You Were Finished," encapsulating his journey and mission to
                    help others overcome their own challenges Steve is actively
                    involved in community service, having served on the City of
                    Doral’s Faith-Based Charities Advisory Committee, the
                    Miami-Dade County Commissioners’ Interfaith Advisory Board,
                    and as a Chaplain with the Doral Police Department. He is
                    also a member of the Champion’s Network with Pastor Joel
                    Osteen and enjoys the fellowship of his Pastor, Mike Hayes.
                    In addition to his ministry, Steve cherishes spending time
                    with his family, including his wife, four adult children,
                    their spouses, and grandchildren. They host a weekly
                    podcast, "The Family Business with The Alessis," sharing
                    insights from their lives in ministry.
